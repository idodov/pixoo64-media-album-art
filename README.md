# üéµ PIXOO64 Media Album Art Display

This AppDaemon script for Home Assistant enhances your music experience by displaying relevant information on your DIVOOM PIXOO64 screen. When music plays, the script automatically fetches and displays the album art of the current track. If album art isn't available, it can generate an image using AI, ensuring a visually engaging experience. The script also supports synchronized lyrics, artist and track info, and can even sync an RGB light's color to match the album art.


## üé® Examples

Here‚Äôs a summary of the main features:
- **Dynamic Album Art:** Displays album art on your PIXOO64 when a track starts playing, scaling and preparing the image for the 64x64 pixel display.
- **Intelligent Fallback:** If album art is unavailable, the script tries to find it online (Spotify, Discogs, Last.fm, MusicBrainz). If all else fails, it generates a unique image using AI.
- **Lyrics Sync:** Fetches and displays synchronized lyrics for supported media sources, advancing as the song plays. *(Note: Not all sources support lyrics.)*
- **Real-Time Info:** Displays the current time, artist's name, and track title on the screen.
- **Spotify Album Slide:** Shows a slideshow of album covers related to the current track, using the Spotify API.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Synchronizes an RGB light's color with the album art's primary color.
- **Special Mode:** An optional display mode combining album art with a clock, day, and temperature, plus artist/title info.

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click on **Helpers**.
3. Click the **Create Helper** button (lower right corner).
4. Select **Toggle** and give it an appropriate name (e.g., `PIXOO64 Album Art`).
5. Note the `entity_id` of this helper (e.g., `input_boolean.pixoo64_album_art`); you will need it later for configuration.
   - **Important:** Ensure this new helper entity is toggled **ON**. If it's off, the script will not run. This toggle allows you to easily disable the script when needed.
6. Add this code to `configuration.yaml` if you want to control the display from Homeassistant UI:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7923467-c901-4981-8017-282c741957de)

```yaml
input_select:
  pixoo64_album_art_display_mode:
    name: Pixoo64 Display Mode
    icon: mdi:application-cog
    options:
      - "Default"
      - "Clean"
      - "AI Generation - Flux"
      - "AI Generation - Turbo"
      - "Text only"

      - "Crop Exra"
```
</details>


### **Step 4: Download the Script**

You can install the script using either **HACS** (Home Assistant Community Store, recommended) or by manually downloading the Python file.

<details>
<summary><strong>HACS (Recommended)</strong></summary>

- When installing through HACS, you **MUST** manually move all files from `/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/apps/` to `/homeassistant/appdaemon/apps/`.
- HACS places files in the `/homeassistant` directory (which can also be mapped as `/config` directory), while AppDaemon expects them in the `/addon_configs` directory.
- If you're using the SAMBA SHARE add-on, Windows File Explorer will show the directory as `/config`, meaning that files should be moved to `/config/appdaemon/apps/`.

1. Open `/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/appdaemon.yaml` and configure it by adding the following line under `appdaemon:`:
   ```yaml
   appdaemon:
      app_dir: /homeassistant/appdaemon/apps/ # DO NOT CHANGE THIS LINE, even if the files are located in the /config directory (when using Samba Share addon)
      latitude: 51.507351 # Update value from https://www.latlong.net
      longitude: -0.127758 # Update value from https://www.latlong.net
   ```

2. Do not remove any existing lines from the file; just add the new line and update the Latitude and Longitude values from https://www.latlong.net

3. If you don‚Äôt have HACS installed, follow the instructions on the [HACS GitHub page](https://hacs.xyz/) to install it.

4. After HACS is set up:
   - Go to the HACS page in Home Assistant.
   - If "AppDaemon" repositories are not found, enable AppDaemon apps discovery and tracking in HACS settings:
     - Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **HACS** > **Configure**.
     - Enable **AppDaemon apps discovery & tracking**.
   - Click on **Custom Repositories** and add `https://github.com/idodov/pixoo64-media-album-art` as an **AppDaemon** repository.
   - Search for and download `PIXOO64 Media Album Art` in HACS.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Download</strong></summary>
   With this method, you will not receive automatic updates.

   
   - Download the Python script directly from the GitHub repository [Download Link](https://github.com/idodov/pixoo64-media-album-art/blob/main/apps/pixoo64_media_album_art/pixoo64_media_album_art.py)
   - Place the file into the directory `/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/apps`.

</details>


### **Step 5: Configure AppDaemon**

To activate the script, you‚Äôll need to modify the `apps.yaml` file. This file is typically located in the `/appdaemon/apps` directory that you added in the previous step.
<details>
<summary><strong>Basic Configuration</strong></summary>
For a minimal setup, add the following to your `/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml` file. Adjust the `ha_url`, `media_player`, and `url` parameters to match your setup.

```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art:
    module: pixoo64_media_album_art
    class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
    home_assistant:
        ha_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"   # Your Home Assistant URL.
        media_player: "media_player.living_room"    # The entity ID of your media player.
    pixoo:
        url: "192.168.86.21"                        # The IP address of your Pixoo64 device.
```

If you have more than one PIXOO64 screen, you can add another configuration block and **change the first line's name**. For example:

```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art_2:
    module: pixoo64_media_album_art
    class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
    home_assistant:
        ha_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"   # Your Home Assistant URL.
        media_player: "media_player.tv_room"        # The entity ID of your media player.
    pixoo:
        url: "192.168.86.22"                        # The IP address of your Pixoo64 device.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Full Configuration</strong></summary>
For all features, use the following configuration. Adjust the values to match your Home Assistant setup and PIXOO64's IP address.

```yaml

<summary><strong>Additional Notes</strong></summary>

### **Light Feature**
The `light` parameter allows you to sync RGB lights with the dominant color of the album art. If the image is black, white, or gray, a soft random color will be selected. You can configure multiple lights using the following syntax:
 ```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art:
    module: pixoo64_media_album_art
    class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
    home_assistant:
       light:
         - "light.living_room"
         - "light.bed_room"
```

### **WLED Integration**
 The WLED feature is designed specifically for WLED lights. It sends a "turn on" command with RGB values corresponding to the dominant colors in the album art. You can control brightness, effects, and palettes, and optionally restrict automation to nighttime hours.
```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art:
   module: pixoo64_media_album_art
   class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
   wled:
        wled_ip: "192.168.86.55"                    # Your WLED IP Adress
        brightness: 255                             # 0 to 255
        effect: 38                                  # 0 to 186 (Effect ID - https://kno.wled.ge/features/effects/)
        effect_speed: 50                            # 0 to 255
        effect_intensity: 128                       # 0 to 255
        pallete: 0                                  # 0 to 70 (Pallete ID - https://kno.wled.ge/features/palettes/)
        only_at_night: False                        # Runs only at night hours
 ```

 ### **Display Lyrics**
 When lyrics are displayed above the image, the image will appear 50% darker if both `text_background` and `lyrics` are set to `True`. Note that this feature is not supported for radio stations.
 Recommend `lyrics_font` values: 2, 4, 32, 52, 58, 62, 48, 80, 158, 186, 190, 590. More values can be found at https://app.divoom-gz.com/Device/GetTimeDialFontList (you need ID value)
 ```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art:
    module: pixoo64_media_album_art
    class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
    pixoo:
        lyrics: True
        lyrics_font: 2
        show_text:
            text_background: True
 ```
 ### **Spotify Slider**
 The Spotify slider enhances the PIXOO64 by showing related album art for the current track. To enable this mode, add your Spotify API keys (client ID and client secret) to `apps.yaml` and set `spotify_slide` to `True`.
 ```yaml
pixoo64_media_album_art:
    module: pixoo64_media_album_art
    class: Pixoo64_Media_Album_Art
    home_assistant:
        spotify_client_id: # Your Spotify API client ID (needed for Spotify features). Obtain from https://developers.spotify.com.
        spotify_client_secret: # Your Spotify API client secret (needed for Spotify features).
    pixoo:
        spotify_slide: True
 ```

## üîÑ **Fallback Image Handling**

When the script cannot directly obtain the album art for the currently playing track, it activates a **sophisticated fallback system** to ensure your PIXOO64 still displays relevant visual information. Below is a summary of the fallback process:

1. **Original Album Art**  
   - The script first tries to use the album art URL provided by the media player.  
   - This is the primary method and works for most local media and some streaming services.

2. **API Services (Spotify, Discogs, Last.fm, TIDAL)**  
   - If the original album art is unavailable, the script queries these services in the following order:  
     1. Spotify  
     2. Discogs  
     3. Last.fm  
     4. TIDAL  
   - The script uses the first image URL it successfully retrieves.

3. **MusicBrainz**  
   - If API services fail, the script queries the **MusicBrainz database**, an open-source music encyclopedia.  
   - MusicBrainz contains many rare artworks but relies on slower server connections, so retrieval may take time.

4. **AI Image Generation**  
   - If all previous methods fail, the script generates an image using **artificial intelligence** via [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai).  
   - You can choose between two AI models:  
     - `turbo`: Produces vibrant images.  
     - `flux`: Creates artistic and colorful styles.  
   - Note: As this is a free service, it may occasionally be laggy or unavailable.

5. **Black Screen with Text**  
   - As a last resort, the script displays a black screen with the artist and title information of the current track.

This **multi-layered approach** ensures that your PIXOO64 always displays some form of visual content, prioritizing accurate APIs and databases before resorting to AI or text representation.


## üîë **API Keys**
To enable advanced features like fetching album art from external services, you‚Äôll need API keys for one or more of the following services. These servers are fast and reliable, making them the most recommended option.
Below are step-by-step guides to help you obtain these keys.

- Use **Spotify**, **Discogs**, **Last.fm**, or **TIDAL** APIs for fast and reliable album art retrieval.  
- If API services fail, the script falls back to **MusicBrainz** or **AI-generated images**.  
- Always store your API keys securely in the `apps.yaml` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the PIXOO64 Media Album Art Display script, refer to the troubleshooting guide below. These are some of the most common problems and their solutions:

- Always double-check your configuration (`apps.yaml`) for typos or missing parameters.
- Ensure proper power supply (3A charger) and Wi-Fi performance for optimal functionality.
- Use appdaemon logging to diagnose issues with the script or integrations.

<details>
<summary><strong>The PIXOO64 is rebooting</strong></summary>

#### **Possible Causes:**
The PIXOO64 has a known internal issue that after sending approximately 300 +/- commands, it crashes.

#### **Solutions:**
Wait for the PIXOO64 to finish initializing. 
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>The PIXOO64 Screen is Blank or Not Updating</summary>
   
#### **Possible Causes:**
- The `input_boolean.pixoo64_album_art` toggle is turned off.
- The media player entity ID in the configuration is incorrect.
- The PIXOO64 device is not connected to the same Wi-Fi network as Home Assistant.
- The script is not running

#### **Solutions:**
1. **Check the Toggle Helper:**  
   - Ensure that the `input_boolean.pixoo64_album_art` toggle is turned **ON**. You can check this in Home Assistant under **Developer Tools**.

2. **Verify Media Player Entity ID:**  
   - Double-check the `media_player` entity ID in your `apps.yaml` file. It should match the entity ID of your media player in Home Assistant.

3. **Check Network Connectivity:**  
   - Ensure the PIXOO64 device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your Home Assistant instance. 

4. **Check Appdaemon Logs**
   - The log can contains reason why the script is fail.

4. **Restart AppDaemon:**  
   - Restart the AppDaemon add-on in Home Assistant to ensure the script is running correctly.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Album Art is Not Displaying</strong></summary>
   
#### **Possible Causes:**
- The media player does not provide album art metadata.
- The media player does not provide artist / track metadata.
- API keys for services like Spotify, Discogs, or Last.fm are missing or incorrect.
- The fallback system (MusicBrainz, AI) is not configured properly.

#### **Solutions:**
1. **Check Metadata Support:**  
   - Verify that your media player provides album art metadata. Some players (e.g., radio streams) may not include album art.

2. **Verify API Keys:**  
   - Ensure that all required API keys from the servies you choose (Spotify, Discogs, Last.fm, TIDAL) are correctly entered in the `apps.yaml` file. Refer to the [API Keys](#api-keys) section for instructions on obtaining these keys. 

3. **Enable Fallback Options:**  
   - If album art is unavailable, ensure that fallback options like MusicBrainz or AI image generation are enabled in the configuration:
     ```yaml
     musicbrainz: True
     ai_fallback: "turbo"
     ```

4. **Test with Different Tracks:**  
   - Try playing tracks from different sources (e.g., Spotify, local files, Radio statations) to see if the issue persists.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>AI-Generated Images Are Not Appearing</strong></summary>
   
#### **Possible Causes:**
- The AI service (`pollinations.ai`) is unavailable or laggy.
- The `ai_fallback` parameter is not set correctly.

#### **Solutions:**
1. **Check AI Service Status:**  
   - Visit [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) to verify that the service is operational. Note that this is a free service and may occasionally be slow or unavailable.

2. **Verify Configuration:**  
   - Ensure that the `ai_fallback` parameter is set to either `"flux"` or `"turbo"` in your `apps.yaml` file:
     ```yaml
     ai_fallback: "turbo"
     ```

3. **Enable Force AI (Optional):**  
   - If you want to test AI-generated images exclusively, set `force_ai` to `True`:
     ```yaml
     force_ai: True
     ```

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>RGB Light Sync Is Not Working</summary>
   
#### **Possible Causes:**
- The RGB light entity ID in the configuration is incorrect.

#### **Solutions:**
1. **Verify Light Entity ID:**  
   - Double-check the `light` parameter in your `apps.yaml` file. It should match the entity ID of your RGB light in Home Assistant:
     ```yaml
     light: "light.living_room"
     ```

2. **Test with Different Images:**  
   - Play tracks with colorful album art to ensure the RGB light sync works as expected.

<details>
<summary><strong>Script Performance Issues</strong></summary>
   
#### **Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient memory due to a large number of cached images.
- Slow Wi-Fi network or power supply issues.

#### **Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Image Cache Size:**  
   - Lower the `images_cache` value in your `apps.yaml` file to reduce memory usage:
     ```yaml
     images_cache: 10
     ```

2. **Optimize Power Supply:**  
   - Use a USB charger with an output of **3A** for optimal performance. Limit screen brightness to no more than **90%** if using a lower-voltage charger.

3. **Reboot Wi-Fi Router:**  
   - If the PIXOO64 responds slowly, reboot your Wi-Fi router to improve network performance.
